# Spec Directory

Place specs in `spec/changes/` using the templates in `spec/templates/`. Each spec should include a short summary, motivation, specification, and alternatives.

When creating a change spec, follow the project's rules in `project_structure/rules.md` and add the spec as a new file with an increasing numeric prefix (e.g., `0001-description.md`).
