# openspec

This repository uses an `openspec/` directory to store architecture and change specifications.

How this folder is organized:

- `spec/changes/` — proposed and accepted change specs (one file per change)
- `spec/archived/` — archived/deprecated specs
- `spec/templates/` — templates for new specs

See `project_structure/rules.md` for project rules that require openspec usage.
